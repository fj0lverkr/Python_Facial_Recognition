# Python_Facial_Recognition
Python app that uses dlib to recognize and cv2 to mark faces in a give picture. GUI made with tkinter.

Note on using dlib:
As this is made in C you'll need to install cmake on your machine and into your project with pip or pipenv.
After adding cmake you can install dlib using pip or pipenv. Note that this will take a while as cmake is now compiling dlib.
This can be resource heavy, best to leave your machine at it and go grab a coffee or something.
